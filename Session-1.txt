Cloud 

cloud vs on-prem



why cloud computing is cheaper to use?

1.lower operating cost
2.Run our infrastructure more efficiently
3.scale as our business needs change

why should we move to the cloud?

1.The team can deliver new features to their users on record speeds
2.users expect an incresingly rich and immersive experience with their softwares
