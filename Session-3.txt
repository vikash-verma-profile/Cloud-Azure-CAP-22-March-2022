Azure Compute Services

1.Azure Virtual Machines
2.Azure Container Instances
3.Azure App Services
4.Azure Functions or serverless computing

-Azure Virtual Machines

Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers.

-Virtual Machine Scale Sets

These are an Azure Compute resource that we can use to deploy or manage a set of identical vms.

-Container and Kubernates
 Thease are Azure compute resources that we can use to deploy and manage containers.
 
 Containers are lightweight ,virtalized application enviornments.
 
 
 -App Services
 
 We can quickly build,Deploy and scale enterprise-level web mobile and Api apps on any platform.
 
 -Functions
 
 This is ideal when we are concerned about only the code running our service and not the platform or infrastructure.

When to user Azure Virtual Machines

1) During Testing and Development
2) When running applications in the cloud
3)when extending your dataceter to the cloud
4) During Disaster recovery

Scale Vms in azure

1.Virtual Machine Scale Sets
2.Azure Batch

1.Virtual Machine Scale Sets==>virtual machine scale sets allow us to create and manage a group of identical,Load-balanced VMS.

2.Azure Batch==>Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and hight performance computing batch jobs with ability to scale to tens,hundreds or thound vms.

Azure App Service

Types of Azure Service

1.Web apps
2.Api apps
3.webjobs
4.Mobile apps

Azure Container and Azure Kubernates Service

What are containers

Containers are a virtaulization enviornments much like running virtual machines on a single physical host.we can multiple containers on a single physical
	or virtual host.
	
Manage Containers

Containers are managed through a container orchestrator.

there are 2 ways

1.Docker
2.Microsoft based containers
	a) Azure Container Instances
	b) Azure Kubernates Service (AKS)
	
	Azure Container Instances==>This is an PAAS offering that allow you to run conatiners which we can run.
	Azure Kubernates Service ==> The task of automating,managing and interacting with large number of conatiners is known as orchestation
		This Service is complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architeture and large amount of containers.
