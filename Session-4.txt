Azure Virtual Networking

Azure Virtual Networks enable azure resources such as VMS,Web apps and databases to communicate with each other with users on the internet

Azure Virtual Networks will have following capabilities:-

a)Isolation and segmentation
b)Internet commuincations
c)commuincations between azure resources
	i)Virtual networks => This can connect not only to the VMs but other azure resources like app service
	ii)Service endpoints ==>This will help us to connect to other azure resources like azure sql and storage accounts
d)commuincations with on-peremises resources
	i)Point to site Virtual private network==>This apporoach to a vPN connection is from computer outside your organisation
	ii)Site to site virtual private network ==>A site to site vpn links your on-prem VPN device or gateway to the azure vpn gateway in a virtual network
	iii)Azure ExpressRoutes==>For the environments where you need greater bandwidth and high level of security .
e)Route network traffic=> azure routes traffic in between subnets on any connected virtual networks ,on-peremises network and the internet
	i) Route Table ==>A route table allows us to define rules about how traffic should be directed.we can create custom route tables 
	ii)Border Gateway Protocol==>BGP works with azure  Vpn Gateway,Azure route servers or expressroute to propgate on-prem BGP routes to AVN
f)filter network traffic
	i) Networks Security Group==>NSG is a azure resource that can have multiple inbound and outbound security rules.
	ii)Network Virtual Appliances==>This Carries out a particular network function,such as running a firewell 
g)connect virtual networks
