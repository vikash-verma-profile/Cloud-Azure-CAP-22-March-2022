Azure Networking Services

Azure Virtual Networking

Azure Virtual Networks enable azure resources such as VMS,Web apps and databases to communicate with each other with users on the internet

Azure Virtual Networks will have following capabilities:-

a)Isolation and segmentation
b)Internet commuincations
c)commuincations between azure resources
	i)Virtual networks => This can connect not only to the VMs but other azure resources like app service
	ii)Service endpoints ==>This will help us to connect to other azure resources like azure sql and storage accounts
d)commuincations with on-peremises resources
	i)Point to site Virtual private network==>This apporoach to a vPN connection is from computer outside your organisation
	ii)Site to site virtual private network ==>A site to site vpn links your on-prem VPN device or gateway to the azure vpn gateway in a virtual network
	iii)Azure ExpressRoutes==>For the environments where you need greater bandwidth and high level of security .
e)Route network traffic=> azure routes traffic in between subnets on any connected virtual networks ,on-peremises network and the internet
	i) Route Table ==>A route table allows us to define rules about how traffic should be directed.we can create custom route tables 
	ii)Border Gateway Protocol==>BGP works with azure  Vpn Gateway,Azure route servers or expressroute to propgate on-prem BGP routes to AVN
f)filter network traffic
	i) Networks Security Group==>NSG is a azure resource that can have multiple inbound and outbound security rules.
	ii)Network Virtual Appliances==>This Carries out a particular network function,such as running a firewell 
g)connect virtual networks


Address space=> when we setup a virtual network we have to define the internal address space in Classless Interdomain Routing(CIDR) format.
	This address spaces must be unique within your subscription and any other network that we are connect to.
	
	10.0.0.0/24  VN1
	Range from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254
	
	10.0.0.0/8  VN2
	10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254
	
Subnets:-Within each virtual network address range we can create one or more subnets that partition the virtual network adress space.
	Routing between subnets will then depends on the default traffic routes.
	we can also define custom routes.

Service endpoints

Nat Gateway=> Network address translation
	A nat gateway is a fully manged and highly resilient NAT service.
	
	
BastionHost=>we can select or disable azure Bastion in our virtual network.Azure Bastion service will provide us a secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectvity
to our virtual machines directly in azure portal.

DDOS pRoctection standard

Firewell 



Create a virtual Network

Subscription=>This option applies if we have multiple subscriptions
Resource Group==>a virtual network needs to exist in resource group.
Network Name==> The name must be unique in the subscription
Region==>region where we want to create network .


what is CIDR?
Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR).The CIDR blocks are group of addresses that share the same prefix and contain the same number of bits.
The combination of muliple connecting CIDR blocks into a large whole,sharing a common network prefix.
SuperNetting

subnets==>sub-network

IP CIDR 	|	Last Ip Address 	| Mask				| Hosts 

a.b.c.d/32							255.255.255.255		 1
a.b.c.d/31							255.255.255.254		 2

Address Space==>
Subnets==> within each virtual address range,we can create one or more subnets that partition the virtual network address spaces
Service Endpoints==>
Nat Gateway==>
