Azure Compute Services

1.Azure Virtual Machines
2.Azure Container Instances
3.Azure App Services
4.Azure Functions or serverless computing

-Azure Virtual Machines

Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers.

-Virtual Machine Scale Sets

These are an Azure Compute resource that we can use to deploy or manage a set of identical vms.

-Container and Kubernates
 Thease are Azure compute resources that we can use to deploy and manage containers.
 
 Containers are lightweight ,virtalized application enviornments.
 
 
 -App Services
 
 We can quickly build,Deploy and scale enterprise-level web mobile and Api apps on any platform.
 
 -Functions
 
 This is ideal when we are concerned about only the code running our service and not the platform or infrastructure.

When to user Azure Virtual Machines

1) During Testing and Development
2) When running applications in the cloud
3)when extending your dataceter to the cloud
4) During Disaster recovery

Scale Vms in azure

1.Virtual Machine Scale Sets
2.Azure Batch

1.Virtual Machine Scale Sets==>virtual machine scale sets allow us to create and manage a group of identical,Load-balanced VMS.

2.Azure Batch==>Azure Batch enables large-scale parallel and hight performance computing batch jobs with ability to scale to tens,hundreds or thound vms.
